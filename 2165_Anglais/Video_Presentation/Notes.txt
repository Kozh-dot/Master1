Hi my name is Samuel LE BERRE. I'm currently doing a master in IT specialized in Bid Data and 3D.
I first got a Diploma of Higher Education in IT where I learn java and sql with Oracle.
I also receive notion on the most use language and framework of web technologies.
Then I did a licence in IT in witch I continue to developpe my java skill and i was introduced to c and c++.
Last summer I was employed in the computing department of the center of reeducation of Kerpape in ploemeur. 
My task was to recreate an existing software made in java years ago but now they want it in php.
During 2 month I work hard alone and successfuly achieved my goal to produce a fully functional software.
I hope to be a software developper because I like to create something from nothing.
Thank you for your attention.
